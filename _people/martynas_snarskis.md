I am an undergraduate BCS student at UR. I'm working with Sabya to try to design a psychophysics task that will allow us to estimate how approximate human inferences are (compared to an ideal Bayesian observer). I am also working with Ankani to make sense of predictions about confidence from the confirmation bias project which contradict the literature. Finally, I am a Take 5 student focusing on limits of and philosophy around mathematical and formal systems.
