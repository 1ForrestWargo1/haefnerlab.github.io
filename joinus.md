# Interested in joining Haefner Lab? 

Potential graduate students should apply to the [Brain and Cognitive Science department](http://www.sas.rochester.edu/bcs/) at the University of Rochester.

Interested undergraduate students should reach out to [Ralf Haefner](mailto:rhaefne2@ur.rochester.edu).

## Postdoc position for modeling complex motion in the presence of self-motion:

We are looking for a postdoctoral research fellow as part of our [multi-university project to investigate the neural underpinnings of causal inference](https://drugowitschlab.hms.harvard.edu/news/postdoctoral-predoctoral-and-data-scientist-positions-multi-university-project).

The successful candidate will develop probabilistic causal inference models of how the brain perceives object motion in the presence of self-motion. These models will span all three of Marr's levels of analysis considering different computational goals, representations and algorithms, and implementations in neural circuits. A key component of the work will be to make model predictions for the neural and behavioral data collected by our experimental collaborators in the lab of Greg DeAngelis. For related references see below.

We expect suitable applicants to have a Doctorate in a related discipline (including psychology, neuroscience, computer science, among others), ideally involving productive research using probabilistic methods. Knowledge of sensory processing and neural data analysis are a plus. If interested, please contact [Ralf Haefner](mailto:rhaefne2@ur.rochester.edu), or [apply through Indeed](https://www.indeed.com/job/postdoctoral-predoctoral-and-data-scientist-positions-causal-inference-e2d1b547bec4c131), while making explicit in the cover letter the position they are applying to.
