    Perception can be characterized as an inference 
    process in which beliefs are formed about the world 
    given sensory observations. The sensory neurons 
    implementing these computations, however, are 
    classically characterized with firing rates, 
    tuning curves, and correlated noise. 
    To connect these two levels of description, we derive
    expressions for how inferences themselves vary across 
    trials, and how this predicts task-dependent patterns 
    of correlated variability in the responses of sensory 
    neurons. Importantly, our results require minimal 
    assumptions about the nature of the inferred variables 
    or how their distributions are encoded in neural activity. 
    We show that our predictions are in agreement with existing 
    measurements across a range of tasks and brain areas. Our 
    results reinterpret task-dependent sources of neural covariability 
    s signatures of Bayesian inference and provide new insights 
    into their cause and their function.
